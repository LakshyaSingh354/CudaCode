# Day 2

- Started PMPP (Programming Massively Parallel Processors)
- Worked on matrix addition using CUDA. Designed the grid and block layout to handle 2D matrices in parallel
- Designed a fake GPU in python to internalize the GPU architecture principles like:
    - Thread Heirarchy
    - SIMT Model
    - Memory Heirarchy (TODO)
    - Asynchronous SIMT (TODO)
